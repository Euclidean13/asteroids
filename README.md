## Architecture

To tackle the challenge, I decided to implement a **Hexagonal Architecture** for both the backend and frontend. This
architecture promotes loose coupling between components, making the system more maintainable, flexible, and testable. It
allows easy swapping of external services (like databases, APIs, etc.) and better separation of concerns between the
core business logic and external integrations.

### Backend: Hexagonal Architecture

The **Hexagonal Architecture** (also known as the Ports and Adapters pattern) helps structure the backend in a way
where:

- The core business logic remains independent from external services (databases, APIs, etc.).
- Different "adapters" interact with the core through well-defined "ports."
- It encourages the use of dependency injection (DI) to decouple classes and make the system easier to test.

### Frontend: Hexagonal Architecture

While Hexagonal Architecture is typically a backend concept, applying it to the frontend ensures:

- Separation of concerns between the core UI logic and services like API calls.
- Flexibility to easily swap or change components and services (like API integrations).
- Improved maintainability and testability by isolating state management, services, and UI components.

## Technologies Used

### Backend

- **TypeScript**: Statically-typed JavaScript for better code quality and developer experience.
- **Node.js**: A runtime environment that allows JavaScript execution on the server side.
- **Inversify (DI Injection)**: A lightweight inversion of control (IoC) container for TypeScript and JavaScript apps to
  support dependency injection.
- **Monads**: Functional programming concepts used to handle side effects, errors, and asynchronous computations in a
  more elegant and predictable way.
- **Jest**: A testing framework with a focus on simplicity, covering unit tests, integration tests, and more.

### Frontend

- **React**: A popular JavaScript library for building dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety in the frontend codebase.
- **Ant Design**: A popular UI library that provides a wide range of pre-built components for building modern UIs
  quickly.
- **Jest**: Used for unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end (E2E) testing of the frontend.

## Differences Between the Challenge and a Real Production System

1. **Testing**:

   - **Challenge**: I implemented unit tests for the business logic, achieving 100% test coverage, with a few
     integration and end-to-end tests on both the backend and frontend.
   - **Production**: I would add more comprehensive integration tests and extensive end-to-end tests, ensuring full
     system reliability. In a real system, I would ensure that testing covers various edge cases and system
     interactions.

2. **Environment Variables**:

   - **Challenge**: Basic environment variables are used.
   - **Production**: I would differentiate environment variables for development, staging, and production environments.
     These variables would be passed to the Docker images to ensure proper configuration for each environment (e.g.,
     database URLs, API keys).

3. **CI/CD Pipeline**:

   - **Challenge**: Not included.
   - **Production**: I would set up a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for automated
     deployment. Depending on the GitFlow model:
     - If using a **master-only** workflow, I would ensure that feature branches are merged into `master` after
       passing all tests, followed by deployment.
     - For environments like **staging** and **production**, I would create releases. Typically, I automate
       environment creation and deployment with **Terraform** for Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

4. **DevOps & Infrastructure**:
   - **Challenge**: Docker configuration was not implemented.
   - **Production**: I would:
     - Create a `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose` setup for both the backend and frontend.
     - Deploy the infrastructure using **Kubernetes** for orchestration and scalability.
     - Manage CI/CD pipelines, deploy infrastructure using **Terraform**, and handle the full DevOps workflow. I have
       experience working with **AWS**, **GCP**, and **OVHCloud** to handle cloud architecture.

## Must-Haves for Production Systems

To ensure a system is robust, scalable, and maintainable in production, I always adhere to the following best practices:

- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit, integration, and end-to-end testing for both frontend and backend with high test
  coverage.
- **Environment Management**: Use environment-specific variables for dev, staging, and production to ensure consistency.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automate build, test, and deployment processes with continuous integration and continuous
  delivery.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Use tools like Terraform to automate cloud infrastructure management.
- **Containerization**: Dockerize applications and leverage Kubernetes for scalable, production-grade deployments.
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Set up robust monitoring (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) and logging systems (e.g., ELK stack)
  to track the health and performance of applications.

By applying these principles and technologies, the system becomes highly adaptable, scalable, and easy to maintain,
ensuring smooth operation from development to production.
